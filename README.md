Network Scanner

This project was undertaken after Completing the Network Fundamentals Course from Google's Professional IT Certificate program hosted on Coursera in order to build upon the theory that I learned in the course. 

The purpose of the netscanner is simply to find all of the devices on a network and list their IP address, MAC address, and device manufacturer. 

This project was completed with the help of a tutorial 
(https://thepythoncode.com/article/building-network-scanner-using-scapy), 
however it was automated (for a linux environment) and extended with Python using my own original thoughts and ideas. 

V1 vs V2: 

The only difference between the 2 is that V2 builds upon V1 and incorporates a MAC address lookup tool that extracts the manufacturer of the network card utilized by the host on the network.

I have included documentation on a few (not all) of the errors that I encountered and what I did to resolve them as well as documentation on how the featured Python code works.
